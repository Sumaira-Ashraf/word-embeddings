# word-embeddings
 a vector with a word is the use of dense "word vectors", also called "word embeddings". While the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse (mostly made of zeros) and very high-dimensional (same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary),  "word embeddings" are low-dimensional floating point vectors
